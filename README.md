Xueting Tao, Jinhao Wang, Yili Wang, Dongyang Zhao

## Data source:
* Data comes from NHANES data, year 1999-2018. Since the overall data is big and complicated, we only keep the cleaned version in the github. However, the code used to clean the data was named as Datacleaning.R, under ./Code folder
* Dataset that were used in the analysis was highed under ./Reference/Codebook for datatable V2.xlsx.
